# üëÄ Proximity Hover

This is a simple JavaScript project that allows you to create a hover effect where eyes follow the mouse pointer. It uses trigonometry to calculate the angle between the mouse cursor and a fixed anchor point, and then rotates the eyes to face the cursor.

## üöÄ Getting Started


To use this project, simply download the proximity.html, proximity.css, and proximity.js files, along with the eye.png and morty.png images. Then, include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document and add the necessary HTML elements.

<code>
<!-- Include the CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="proximity.css">

<!-- Include the JavaScript file -->
<script defer src="proximity.js"></script>

<!-- Add the anchor image and eyes container to your HTML -->
<main>
  <img id="anchor" src="morty.png" alt="morty">
  <div id="eyes">
    <img class="eye1" src="eye.png" alt="eye1">
    <img class="eye2" src="eye.png" alt="eye2">
    <img class="eye3" src="eye.png" alt="eye3">
    <img class="eye4" src="eye.png" alt="eye4">
  </div>
</main>

</code>

  3.JavaScript
  
  
  ## üé® Customizing the Effect
  
You can customize the position and appearance of the eyes by editing the CSS code. Each eye is represented by a class name (e.g. .eye1, .eye2, etc.) that has a specific top, bottom, left, or right position.

<code>

/* Set position for each eye class */
.eye1 {
    top: 96px;
    right: 21px;
}

.eye2 {
    top: 118px;
    right: 136px;
}

.eye3 {
    bottom: 96px;
    left: 186px;
}

.eye4 {
    bottom: 93px;
    left: 89px;
}
